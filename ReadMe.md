## License

The Velocem source code (and associated build/test/utility files) is released
into the public domain, see `License` for details.

I (Vito Gamberini) hold no patents and have no knowledge of any patented
techniques used by Velocem. However, some organizations refuse to incorporate or
distribute public domain code due to patent concerns, for this reason Velocem is
additionally licensed for use under Zlib, see `UsageLicense` for details.

As the source code itself is public domain, there is no need to retain licensing
information in full or partial source code distributions unless the patent
concerns are of significance to you.
